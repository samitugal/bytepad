# Sprint 29: Knowledge Graph Interactivity

## Overview
Make Knowledge Graph nodes fully interactive with drag & drop support.

## Status: PLANNED
- Target: 2026-01-13

## Tasks

### 1. Drag & Drop Nodes [HIGH]
- [ ] Implement mouse drag to move nodes
- [ ] Node follows cursor while dragging
- [ ] Node stays in new position after release
- [ ] Prevent simulation from resetting dragged node position
- [ ] Visual feedback during drag (cursor, highlight)

### 2. Pan & Zoom Support [MEDIUM]
- [ ] Add mouse wheel zoom
- [ ] Add drag to pan canvas
- [ ] Reset view button

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Nodes can be dragged to new positions
- [ ] Graph remains stable after interaction
- [ ] Smooth 60fps interaction performance
