bytepad is a keyboard-first, privacy-first productivity app built for people who think better in plain text.

It brings together notes, tasks, habits, and lightweight planning in a single, calm workspace—without forcing you into rigid systems or complex knowledge graphs. The goal isn’t to manage your life, but to reduce friction between thinking and doing.

Inspired by the clean, distraction-free aesthetics of code editors, bytepad favors:

* fast startup and instant interaction
* minimal UI, maximal focus

Your data stays local and under your control. No accounts, no tracking, no dark patterns. Sync and structure exist to support you, not to lock you in.

Bytepad is designed around a simple belief: 
> Productivity tools should feel more like a text editor than a dashboard.
> 
> Open it, type, think, close it.

## Why bytepad exists

bytepad exists because I think modern productivity tools often confuse structure with clarity.

Over time, notes turn into databases, simple tasks become workflows, and thinking gets replaced by organizing. I found myself spending more time maintaining the system than actually using it.

The principles behind bytepad are intentionally simple:

* Plain text over abstraction – if I can type it, I can use it
* Keyboard-first by default – thinking is faster than clicking
* Local-first, privacy-first – my data should stay mine
* Low cognitive load – the tool should disappear while I work

bytepad is built for people who enjoy the calm of a code editor, the flexibility of markdown, and the feeling of opening an app that never asks, “How would you like to organize this?”

## Generate your knowledge graph

bytepad doesn’t ask you to build a knowledge graph. It lets one emerge naturally.

Notes, tasks, habits, journal entries, and bookmarks are all treated as first-class entities. Anything can link to anything else using simple, readable connections. 
Over time, these links form a personal knowledge graph that reflects how you actually think—not how a tool expects you to organize information.
